// Take two arrays find union of both array 

// intersection of both array


// find a1-a2 ( all elements of a1 which are not in a2)
// [10,20]

// find a2-a1 ( all elements of a2 which are not in a1)



// symmetric difference => not common elements of both array
// [10,20,60,70]


// check if array2 is subset of array1. means all elements of array2 are present in array1


// given an array check if it has only unique elements or not
